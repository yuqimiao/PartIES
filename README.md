## Instructions:
We propose PartIES: a disease subtyping framework with Partition-level Integration using diffusion-Enhanced Similarities from Multi-omics Data

The source code and examples are available [Here](https://github.com/yuqimiao/PartIES/blob/main/example_with_simulation.R)

# Requirements
You can install the dependencies using the following command:
```r
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "igraph", "SNFtool"))
```

Be sure to download the entire `./R` directory when running the example code.

# Usage
* `./R/PartIES.R` contains all the dependencies and functions.
* `./example_with_simulation.R` provides an example of usage with a simulation to generate data. Detailed comments can be found in the script.
